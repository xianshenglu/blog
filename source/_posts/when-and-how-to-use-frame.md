## Preface

There has been a long time that I don't know whether should I use frame like `jQuery` or still stick to pure js. So, I decided to summarize some principles for future reference.

## Main

#### Before using

1.  Figure out the problem that the frame solved?
2.  Figure out what kind of situation the frame would be useful, similar with above.
3.  Why would so many people use this not other similar frames?
4.  How many parts in the frame?
5.  What is the relationship between those parts?

#### When should use

- Needed in work.
- Emancipate the productive forces based on the fact that you can solve this with ease by pure js.

#### When shouldn't use

- Don't need in work and you don't know how to implement it with pure js and use it just for laze.
- Need it in work and just use it without understanding the principle.

## Recommendation

- You can implement it with pure js easily so that you want to use it to emancipate the productive forces.
- In need of other situation, you have to implement it immediately so you use it and figure out the principle as soon as possible in case of bugs.
